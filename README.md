# nbt-project
main,  includes the main page.
(main) in navigation bar, only signup and shop works( only these two accessible ).
login/signup part is so silly dont laugh ...
among these ready parts of the project , only  shop is responsive(change the size of your browser)...(lack of time to make them all responsive ).
i tried to make the div.navbar(in main.html ....> style.css) sticky but i failed. <HELP>
